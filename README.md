Drupal 7 'Person Entity' Module
===============================

core = 7.x

version = "7.x-1.0-dev"

Introduction
------------
This module provides a fully working 'Person' entity for your site. It is useful when you need to keep track of various
people but who aren't in the standard website user group.


Installation
-------------
Once you activate/enable the module, it sets up an entity administration interface under
Admnistration > Structure > Person Types

You can add person entities via

Administration > Content > Persons

Keep in mind that you need to create some Person Types before you can add entities.

Finally, you can theme the person entity with person.tpl.php and person-sample-data.tpl.php
